# Drag-Drop
This drag &amp; drop application has been implemented in two ways. One approach is using Vanilla JavaScript, where the following events were used to successfully achieve this: dragstart, dragover and the drop event. The second approach involves using React and its library react-beautiful-dnd, which enables a much more elegant design and animations.
